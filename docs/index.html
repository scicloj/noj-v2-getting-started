SUMMARY:SciNoj Light 1st conference
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:In recent months, the Clojure toolkit for data and science has been maturing. Thus, in 2025, Scicloj can finally shift more resources into making it accessible and well-known.\nSciNoj Light is one of the first steps in that direction.\nSciNoj Light is an online conference where Clojurians will share their short-term data analysis.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/494697398

SUMMARY:Data-recur meeting 7 - R4Clj 1: Introducing R ...
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Data-recur meeting 7 - R4Clj 1: Introducing R and the Tidyverse\n\nThe data-recur group will have its next meeting on Jan 31st.\nThis will be a beginning of a series of meetups, where we introduce the R languages and its ecosystem to the Clojure crowd.\nWhile Clojure already has an established collection of libraries for data science, it can be enlightening for Clojurians to learn about a different-but-similar language. A few of the Clojure data science libraries, such as Tablecloth and Tableplot, are explicitly inspired by R and its packages. To encourage additional inspiration of this kind, we will host a few meetings for the Clojure audience to discuss R and its relationship with Clojure.\nAgenda for this meeting\n\nThe R language\nThe Tidyverse packages\nA small example\nDiscussion\n\nJoining \n\nPlease mark your participation using the Your rsvp button at the top of this page (requires Clojureverse login).\nPlease join the Clojurians Zulip chat beforehand.\nYou can also use the Add to Calendar button to add the event to your calendar.\n\nPreparing for this meeting\nBefore the meeting, it is recommended to install R and the Tidyverse package in your system and play with the R REPL a little bit.\nLength\nThe official part will be 90 minutes long.\nSometimes some of us like to stay longer and chat.\nPlatform\n\nVideo meeting: Launch Meeting - Zoom\nText chat: We will use the #data-recur Zulip stream (requires Zulip login).\n\nRecording\nSome parts of the meeting will be recorded and probably shared publicly.\nSome parts will be unrecorded.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/494306905

For example, to specify a map with one key or another but not both, the dreaded addition of :and + :fn is needed to assert a postcondition on the map. This then negatively affects error messages and generating examples.\nWe then propose a clean solution to this problem, and many problems like it, by adding support for constraints on individual schemas.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/465033062

DESCRIPTION:Electric Clojure v3: Differential Dataflow for UI (by Dustin Getz)\n\nTHIS IS AN ONLINE EVENT\n[Connection details will be shared 1h before the start time]\nThe London Clojurians are happy to present:\nTitle: Electric Clojure v3: Differential Dataflow for UI\nSpeaker: Dustin Getz\nTime: 2024-08-20 @ 18:30 (London time)\nLocal time: click here for local time\nDustin Getz (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dustingetz/) will be presenting:\n&amp;quot;Electric Clojure v3: Differential Dataflow for UI&amp;quot;\n18 months ago, we released Electric v2 and early adopters have been running it in production since last summer, to build rich web experiences that simply have too much interactivity, realtime streaming, and too rich network connections to be able to write all the frontend/backend network plumbing by hand. With Electric v2, we demonstrated that we weren&amp;rsquo;t crazy, this thing is commercially viable in real apps. But it also had growing pains: rendering collections was tricky, and v2&amp;rsquo;s electric lambdas had serious shortcomings. Electric v3 is a rewrite of the network runtime, fixing and resolving these issues with a new computational structure based on differential dataflow: diffs through the reactivity graph from database to dom, no collections sent over the wire ever, only diffs. This talk is a preview of Electric v3, in the form of working examples, where we will dive into the nuance of writing network transparent programs in practice, demonstrating how Electric v3's differential semantics reveal and align with the deep computational structure of a user interface.\nDustin Getz is the founder of Hyperfiddle, low-code declarative infrastructure for user interfaces. Hyperfiddle's mission is to collapse to zero the cost of frontend development for a wide range of applications, by applying distributed systems and concurrency techniques to build a new class of UI infrastructure. Dustin's research interest is in the computational structure of user interfaces.\nIf you missed this event, you can watch the recording on our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LondonClojurians\n(The recording will be uploaded a couple of days after the event.)\nPlease, consider supporting the London Clojurians with a small donation:\nhttps://opencollective.com/london-clojurians/\nYour contributions will enable the sustainability of the London Clojurians community and support our varied set of online and in-person events:\n\nClojureBridge London: supports under-represented groups discover Clojure\nre:Clojure: our free to attend annual community conference\nmonthly meetup events with speakers from all over the world\nsubscription and admin costs such as domain name &amp;amp; StreamYard subscription\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\n\nhttps://juxt.pro/\nhttps://flexiana.com/\nAnd many individual sponsors\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/463448312

LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Visual-tools meeting 26 - Gemini, Space-Age, protocols from the REPL\n\nThe visual tools group will have its 26th meeting on June 16th.\nIn this meeting, Gary Johnson and @Daniel_Szmulewicz will give two talks regarding the use of internet protocols from Clojure.\nFor the background that has motivated the meetings, see the recent discussion at the Clojure mailing group.\nAgenda\n(see the detailed abstracts below)\n\nGary Johnson - Space-Age and the Gemini Protocol (Clojure on the Small Web)\nDaniel Szmulewicz - How not to be protocolary with protocols\nDiscussion\n\nJoining\nPlease write to @daslu or comment below if you wish to participate. You can also use the Add to Calendar to add the event to your calendar.\nLength\nThe official part will be 90 minutes long.\nSometimes, some of us like to stay longer and chat.\nVideo Call\nZoom link: Launch Meeting - Zoom\nRecording\nPossibly, we will share a recording of parts of the meeting. This has not been decided yet.\nTalk abstracts\nSpace-Age and the Gemini Protocol (Clojure on the Small Web) - Gary Johnson\nGemini is a text-centric, persistent communication protocol based\naround a hyperlinked web of documents that is now almost 5 years old.\nIn many ways, it feels like the early web, but at the same time, it\nprovides privacy and authentication through the use of TLS encryption\nand client-side X.509 certificates.\nThe protocol itself is an exercise in elegant minimalism and can be\neasily understood and implemented by a single developer with a few\ndays of effort. All requests are encrypted. Request and response\nheaders are extremely minimal, and there are no cookies. Every request\nserves a single document with no cascaded downloads, and there is no\nclient-side programming language like Javascript. Taken together,\nthese features ensure a private, safe, and user-driven browsing\nexperience without the need for ad blockers, browser extensions, or\nsimilar defensive measures.\nWhile the feature set may seem minimal, Gemini&amp;rsquo;s community has been\nextremely creative in the content that they have produced over the\nyears. In particular, server-side CGI scripting is well supported.\nBecause Clojure programmers also deserve a great experience in writing\nGemini pages and applications, I developed the Space-Age Gemini server\nin Clojure in the summer and fall of 2020. While having zero\ndependencies beyond Clojure itself, Space-Age supports a unique\nRing-like programming model that enables easy server-side scripting in\nour favorite programming language.\nIn this talk, I will demonstrate Space-Age&amp;rsquo;s features and show off\nsome of my favorite Gemini applications.\nUseful Links:\n\nhttps://geminiprotocol.net/\nProject Gemini FAQ\nGary Johnson / space-age &amp;middot; GitLab\n\nHow not to be protocolary with protocols - Daniel Szmulewicz\nI would like to talk about how Internet protocols can be fun to play with, especially at the REPL. Simple protocols like Intetd or SOCKS present a good learning experience for socket programming. Even HTTP, the opposite of a simple protocol, can be tamed given enough irreverence. I will talk about the blog post &amp;ldquo;The Anatomy Of a HTTP Server&amp;rdquo; and how the exercise led to an actual insight regarding web frameworks.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/438968418

DESCRIPTION:HYBRID: Immutable Databases to Set Your Distributed System Free\n\nWriting software is just great until you need to get two different machines to agree on some state. Then you have to start solving some difficult problems. In Clojure we can see how immutable data makes building concurrent programs manageable -- what if we could apply those same lessons to our distributed systems? We'll talk about what an immutable database is, how it works in principle and in practice, and why you'll want to use one to make your life easier.\nThe talk will also be streamed live and a VOD will be posted later: https://youtube.com/live/zx4HGVx9NR8\nAgenda:\n\n6:30pm arrive, pizza served\n7:00pm talk\n7:45pm all questions\n8:00pm end stream, offline questions\n8:30pm end meetup, people who want to hang out can choose from nearby bars and restaurants\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/432397097

DESCRIPTION:Is there a place for LLM orchestration tools? (by Žygimantas Medelis)\n\nTHIS IS AN ONLINE EVENT\n[Connection details will be shared 1h before the start time]\nThe London Clojurians are happy to present:\nTitle: Is there a place for LLM orchestration tools?\nSpeaker: Žygimantas Medelis\nTime: 2024-04-09 @ 18:30 (London time)\nLocal time: click here for local time\nŽygimantas Medelis (https://x.com/zzgmm) will be presenting:\n&amp;quot;Is there a place for LLM orchestration tools?&amp;quot;\nEvery second week LLM space is hit by a major announcement of new models and improved AI capabilities. Given this breakneck progress, do we need a layer of LLM orchestration tools? I argue that the answer is yes, and I'll use Bosquet &amp;ndash; an LLM tooling library &amp;ndash; to illustrate my point. I will show that going beyond simple LLM apps you will need support for complex promoting and workflows, model swapping, memory management, and similar functionality offered by LLM tools like Bosquet.\nŽygis has been working in Clojure, Natural Language Processing, and adjacent fields for about 15 years, and is always interested in ways to extract meaning from all the messy data we are producing. Very excited about LLMs - a technology that might finally allows us to do just that.\nIf you missed this event, you can watch the recording on our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LondonClojurians\n(The recording will be uploaded a couple of days after the event.)\nPlease, consider supporting the London Clojurians with a small donation:\nhttps://opencollective.com/london-clojurians/\nYour contributions will enable the sustainability of the London Clojurians community and support our varied set of online and in-person events:\n\nClojureBridge London: supports under-represented groups discover Clojure\nre:Clojure: our free to attend annual community conference\nmonthly meetup events with speakers from all over the world\nsubscription and admin costs such as domain name &amp;amp; StreamYard subscription\n\nThank you to our sponsors:\n\nhttps://juxt.pro/\nhttps://flexiana.com/\nAnd many individual sponsors\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/426007215

SUMMARY:Leveling Up Clojure Runtime Specs @ambrosebs
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Madison Clojure Meetup presents 'Leveling Up Clojure Runtime Specs' by Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant.\n\nTalk description:\nClojure has a powerful selection of dynamic verification tools, including Schema, Spec, and Malli. In this talk, we will motivate the need for even more expressive runtime specifications. Repurposing familiar ideas from static types and interpreters, we will explore higher-level abstractions over runtime specs that bump up their expressivity without compromising their dynamism.\n\nAbout the speaker:\nAmbrose has been an active member of the Clojure community since 2011. He has participated in the development of many dynamic verification tools for Clojure, including trammel, core.contracts, dynalint, Schema, Spec, test.chuck, typed.clj.spec and Malli. He is the creator of Typed Clojure, the subject of his PhD thesis, and a maintainer of Plumatic Schema.\n\nSpeaker Website: https://ambrosebs.com\n\nThis event will be streamed live here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vAyJPwogSI\n\nA VOD will be available at some point after the stream.\n\nPlease join #clojure-madison on Clojurians Slack to participate.\n\nAgenda (Central Time):\n- 6:30pm local meetup starts\n- 7:00pm talk (and stream) starts\n- 7:45pm questions\n  - please leave a comment on the stream or post on #clojure-madison in Clojurians slack.\n- 8:00pm stream ends\n- 8:30pm local meetup ends\n\nTo attend in person, please sign up here: https://www.meetup.com/madison-clojure-meetup/events/299428825/\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/423308711

SUMMARY:A First Look at XTDB v2
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Over the last couple of years, the XTDB team has been hard at work on XTDB v2 (XT2), and we're excited to now be at a point where we can share it with the XT community for first impressions and feedback. \n\nKey takeaways:\n\n1. Understand what to expect from XT2 — what's new/ improved from XT1, and what's still to come before a stable release\n2. Run your first query using XTQL — our new data-oriented, composable query language\n3. Learn how to get involved in the journey to general availability, and help shape our roadmap\n\nJoin James Henderson — Head of Engineering at XTDB — as he lifts the lid on XT2 development. In this session, James will:\n\n* Outline the high-level motivation behind XT2\n* Follow the journey of an XTDB document, from transaction submission to query, covering the differences in high-level architecture between XT1 and XT2\n* Introduce XTQL in an interactive demo — talking about its inspiration, and walking through how to compose the different operators\n* Demonstrate the interoperability of SQL and XTQL — showing how data inserted using one can be queried using the other\n* Talk about what's next for XT2, the feedback we are seeking, and how you can help\n\nAfter the presentation &amp; demo, James will do a live Q&amp;A session with the audience. \n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/408192038

One of the more popular options in ClojureScript is re-frame - a well thought through &amp;amp; documented data loop, helping us manage state in a controlled way - derived data, flowing. re-dash is to ClojureDart what re-frame is to ClojureScript - a reactive state manager for Flutter's UI that uses events to update and subscriptions to react to changes. We'll look at the 6 dominoes of this data loop falling, each triggering the next, from when an event gets triggered until the Flutter widget gets rebuilt. We might even throw in some side effects for fun.\nWerner has worked for Hospitality Technology International (HTI) since 2001, dedicating the majority of his professional career to developing hotel booking systems with Java.

SUMMARY:Atomic Architecture
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Atomic Architecture — An Architectural Vision for Better Information Systems\n\nAs part of our drive to design better data systems for our customers, we’ve identified 7 architectural principles that yield exceptional results.\n\nIn this webinar, JUXT CTO &amp; co-founder — Malcolm Sparks — will explain the principles behind Atomic Architecture, an architectural blueprint for building reliable information systems.\n\nMalcolm will argue that current trends in software architecture create unnecessary complexity, delivering poor outcomes for users.\n\nAtomic Architecture incorporates key ideas and principles from Functional Programming, Domain Driven Design, Event Driven Architecture, Data Mesh and more — to let data take back its central place at the heart of a distributed information system.\n\nA system that is built with the principles of Atomic Architecture has a number of benefits, across the entire data set:\n* A single source of truth\n* Full auditability with historical versioning: who did what? what happened when? \n* Secure object-level access control\n\nKey takeaways from this session:\n1. In practical terms, learn how to design a system that's compliant with Atomic Architecture\n2. Discover available tools and technologies\n3. See how to integrate Atomic Architecture into existing software infrastructure\n\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/392335860

LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Scicloj LLM meetup 5: Library overviews and selected discussions\n\nThe Clojure ecosystem around LLMs has been growing, with a few new libraries and other projects. Quite a lot of that activity is discussed at the #clojurellm channel on the Clojurians Slack. You can also see most of the relevant libraries listed on the Scicloj website.\nWhile LLMs are not the current main focus of the Scicloj group, it has been organizing a meetups series to assist some of those explorations. It was done in collaboration with the wise friends at the #clojurellm channel, who&amp;rsquo;ve kindly agreed to give talks and contribute to the discussions.\nThis event aims to explore a few of the current development directions in this field.\n\nJoining\nPlease Reply below and mention that you plan to attend. You can also inform me by a private message.\nYou can use the Add to Calendar button to add the event to your calendar.\n\nContributing to the agenda\nPlease let us know if you wish to present a project or propose a discussion topic.\nYou can propose it either in a comment replying to this post or by mentioning @daslu on the #clojurellm Slack channel. Private messages are also welcome.\nFurther planning of the session will take place on Slack.\n\nAgenda (gradually updating)\n\nshort project overviews by some of the library makers\nselected discussions of topics proposed in advance\nadditional discussion\n\n\nAssumed background\nThis session will not teach the basics of LLMs. We may assume some familiarity with the common notions, mainly regarding using LLMs and composing them with other software components.\nYou are encouraged to watch the recordings of previous meetups for some background.\nSome familiarity with Clojure will be assumed, and maybe also some Python.\n\nLength\nThe official part will be 90 minutes long.\nSometimes, some of us like to stay longer and chat.\n\nVideo Call\nZoom link: Launch Meeting - Zoom\n\nRecording\nSome parts of this meeting will be recorded and shared publicly.\nSome parts will not be recorded, to allow the conversation to flow freely.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/390540499

DESCRIPTION:Bitemporality and the Art of Maintaining Accurate Databases\n\nBitemporality and the Art of Maintaining Accurate Databases.\nHow often have you had to add a `modified_at` or `effective_from` column to a database table? \nHave you ever had to keep old versions of data around and make it visible to end users?\n\nTime is a fundamental aspect of data modeling — and yet application developers are frequently reduced to rolling their own half-baked ‘bitemporal’ SQL schemas on top of popular database systems. \n\nThis ad hoc approach to handling time has been the status quo for decades, but it's a complicated, risky business — and new systems can do better.\n\nBitemporal modeling equips developers with a rigorous abstraction for working with immutable data and versioned records.\n\nJoin this webinar to discover the most common use cases for bitemporal modeling, and learn how it impacts the design and maintenance of applications.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n* Familiarize yourself with the SQL:2011 standard temporal features\n* Understand the landscape of existing approaches and tools for implementing bitemporality to ensure successful projects \n* Discover how you can visualize your own bitemporal data using an open source interactive tool\n\nAt the end of the session, after Q&amp;A, our speakers will share a quick demo of XTDB: a modern database that incorporates a bitemporal index at its core. \n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/381459265

With Nodely it is possible to express\nconditional dependencies declaratively and decouple declaration from\nexecution. We are able to run the same dependency definition with\nmultiple engines such as: lazy synchronous, async with core-async,\nasync with promesa and potentially many others, unlocking the power of\nasync and avoiding execution of unneeded dependencies.\nSophia Velten is a Computer Engineer currently working at Nubank as a\nSenior Staff Software Engineer, where she designed State Flow, an open\nsource Clojure library which is the standard integration testing\nframework at Nubank. Her main interest in tech is the interface\nbetween humans and machines, which usually means language. She enjoys\na bunch of esoteric languages ranging from Ancient Greek to Haskell,\nLisps (Clojure) and Smalltalk and tends to apply category theory in\nmore places than it is advisable.

Its overarching design goal is sustainable\ndevelopment speed as time goes and code grows and it really shows\nup. It is developer friendly, with minimal boilerplate, and features\nyou need for any serious application. And it is surprisingly\nflexible. Fulcro is based on a few simple ideas that combine\npowerfully to produce a multitude of capabilities, including its Rapid\nApplication Development &amp;quot;add-on&amp;quot;. Some people find Fulcro complicated\nand scary - but it doesn't need to be. Stop choosing &amp;quot;simpler&amp;quot; web\nframeworks - and ending up implementing half of Fulcro with much more\neffort and verbosity and much less value. I will present the\nminimalist way of learning Fulcro with its three corner stones and\nexplain Fulcro's building blocks. After this talk, you will understand\nthe design and value of Fulcro, be motivated to learn it, and equipped\nto do so quickly.\nJakub has been developing enterprise software since 2005, fell in love\nwith Clojure in 2012, and with Fulcro in 2020. He cares deeply about\nproductivity (and thus Clojure, DevOps, and Fulcro) and quality and\nenjoys sharing his discoveries and thoughts on his blog. Aside of his\ndaily job, he also mentors and pair-programs with Fulcro beginners. He\ncomes from the Czech Republic and lives currently in Norway.\nIf you missed this event, you can watch the recording on our YouTube channel:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/@LondonClojurians\n(The recording will be uploaded a couple of days after the event.)\nPlease, consider supporting the London Clojurians with a small donation:\nhttps://opencollective.com/london-clojurians/\nYour contributions will enable the sustainability of the London\nClojurians community and support our varied set of online and\nin-person events:\n- ClojureBridge London: supports under-represented groups discover Clojure\n- re:Clojure: our **free** to attend annual community conference\n- monthly meetup events with speakers from all over the world\n- subscription and admin costs such as domain name &amp;amp; Zoom plan for\nlarger online meetups\nThank you to our sponsors:\n- https://juxt.pro/\n- https://flexiana.com/\n- https://gaiwan.co/\n- https://freshcodeit.com/\n- https://nette.io/\n- https://nilenso.com/\n- And many individual sponsors\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/358742727

SUMMARY:2023-04-06 Clojure Transducers: Sequence Processing on ...
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Clojure Transducers: Sequence Processing on Steroids\n\nSpeaker: Mayank Prakash\nTopic: Clojure Transducers: Sequence Processing on Steroids\nTransducers in Clojure harness the power of higher-order functions to implement separation of concerns in sequence processing. They allow the same standard sequence processing functions like map, filter, take, partition, etc. to work with any source of sequential data, whether in-memory data structures, event streams, core.async channels, queues, etc. and to produce output in any of these formats. Additionally, as a side effect, they also allow us to eliminate intermediate data structures when chaining multiple operations.\nIn this talk, we will introduce the concept using a step-by-step approach to explain transducers, and show how we can leverage them in our own code.\nAgenda:\n6:30 Pre-presentation hellos\n6:45 Presentation, Q&amp;amp;A\n7:45 Post-presentation discussions, breakouts as warranted\nAbout our Speaker:\nMayank Prakash is an Application Architect and a software veteran of more than 4 decades. His first introduction to Lisp was in the early 80's and he was floored by the power and flexibility of the language. Since then he has dabbled in multiple Lisp dialects, including Interlisp, Common Lisp, Elisp, Scheme, and most recently, Clojure. Clojure in particular has become his first choice for functional programming.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/342261008

I'm guessing never.\nIn this talk I&amp;rsquo;m going to show you how you can find the Pokemon that shares your features and see if you could win all Pokemon battles if you were this Pokemon.\nAlthough I&amp;rsquo;m sure that finding your matching Pokemon is an interesting thing to learn, what we will truly focus on is the magical Clojure library that I used to get this magic happen - Tablecloth!\nTablecloth is a Clojure library that we can use for performing queries on columnar datasets.\nWe will go through the main features this library offers, see code examples of using Tablecloth and compare these code examples with the same queries done in other ways in Clojure.\nWe will think together - which way is preferred for use in different use cases.\nJoin me on the journey of learning about Tablecloth and finding your matching Pokemon.\nEven if you&amp;rsquo;ve never thought about your matching Pokemon, aren't you just a little bit curious?\nMey Beisaron\nMey is a Software Engineer, a Public speaker and a Mentor.\nWhen she is not spending her weekends coding games or speaking at tech conferences, she experiments with algorithms or playing Super Mario Bros on the Nintendo Switch.\nAs she recently joined the Infrastructure forces at Forter, Clojure is not her main development language anymore, but it will forever be her favorite one.\nMey is a sworn Star Wars fan.

SUMMARY:Eleventh Func Prog Sweden MeetUp 2022 &amp;ndash; ...
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Eleventh Func Prog Sweden MeetUp 2022 &amp;ndash; Online\n\nThe program\n\nIntro by Magnus Sedlacek\nHow Griffin uses tap&amp;gt; and portal to understand and debug their event-driven architecture by James Trunk\nA Sweet Beginner's Guide to Scala by Daniel Cioc&amp;icirc;rlan\nReduce system complexity with Data-Oriented Programming by Yehonathan Sharvit\nThis Is Not a Monad Tutorial by John Azariah\n\nJames Trunk\nJames is a technology leader, with two decades of experience building successful digital products and high performing teams. He started his career as a software developer, but an early interest for people, processes, and psychology pulled him towards leadership.\nJames loves to transform teams and perfect products, which he&amp;rsquo;s done in previous roles as a Product Owner, CTO, and Head of Engineering. He has board experience, has advised leadership teams, and coached C-level executives.\nJames also co-developed and open sourced an exciting new approach to software architecture called Polylith, and occasionally finds the time to teach functional programming on YouTube.\nhttps://linkedin.com/in/james-trunk\nA Sweet Beginner's Guide to Scala\nScala can be very intimidating at first sight, but it doesn't have to be. In this talk for beginners, we'll cover the nice and sweet aspects of Scala that make it a powerful, concise, expressive and effective programming language.\nDaniel Cioc&amp;icirc;rlan\nDaniel is a Scala developer and the founder of Rock the JVM, a learning platform for everything in the Scala ecosystem (and beyond). He has taught more than 70000 developers with his free and premium online courses, and he has personally trained engineering teams at companies like Apple, Adobe and Microsoft (yes, they use Scala, too).\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/danielciocirlan/\nReduce system complexity with Data-Oriented Programming\nComplexity is one of the main difficulties in the development of successful software systems. Modern programming languages and frameworks make it easy to develop and deploy our code quickly, but as the code base grows, complexity makes it challenging to add new features.\nData-Oriented programming is a paradigm that aims at reducing the complexity of information systems such as back-end applications, web services, web workers, and front-end applications by rethinking data.\nData-Oriented programming treats data as an immutable value that is manipulated by general-purpose functions. Moreover, data is validated &amp;agrave; la carte.\nIn this talk, we illustrate the principles of Data-Oriented programming in the context of a software production system.\nAfter attending this talk, you will be able to apply Data-Oriented programming principles in your preferred programming language and reduce the complexity of the systems you build.\nTakeaways\n\nApply Data-Oriented Programming principles in your preferred programming language\nApply data validation techniques without using static types\nRepresent data with immutable data structures\nManipulate data with generic functions\n\nYehonathan Sharvit\nYehonathan has been working as a software engineer since 2000, programming with C++, Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Clojure, and ClojureScript.\nCurrently, he is a software architect at Cycognito, building software infrastructures for high-scale data pipelines.\nHe is the author of Data-Oriented programming, published by Manning.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/viebel/\nThis Is Not a Monad Tutorial\nAs a new functional programmer, I struggled with a lot of new terminology, intimidating mathematics, strange concepts &amp;ndash; and virtually every discussion I had made me feel like my 2 decades of experience as a professional software engineer hadn&amp;rsquo;t prepared me for FP.\nNow, after many years of working with FP in the industry, and having brought many people along the journey, I have some learnings about how to communicate some foundations of functional programming to professional software engineers &amp;ndash; starting with why functional programming matters, how to get started, how to be effective, and how to improve over time.\nSo, we&amp;rsquo;ll talk about that today. We&amp;rsquo;ll explore how functional programming comes naturally with a few different perspectives and a few fundamental concepts, and hopefully look at programming in a new light. There will be a little mathematical notation, but nothing that should leave a professional software engineer stymied!\nJohn Azariah Principal SDE, Microsoft\nJohn is a frequent speaker at conferences on various topics of expertise including Quantum Computing, Functional Programming, Cloud Computing, and Software Engineering. He has over three decades of experience in writing software, designing software systems, and leading teams to deliver software products, services and platforms all over the world. He currently works for Microsoft in Australia for the AKS team, and was previously on the Microsoft Quantum team, where he was one of the designers of the Q# programming language.\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/johnaz/\nVideo sponsor &amp;ndash; Ada Beat\nhttps://adabeat.com\n#funcprogsweden\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/314211586

This is done in the so-called Kindly project, that is going through changes these days.\nIn the near future, we will start writing various learning resources this way, and gradually collaborate with tool-makers to write adapters, so that our notes will render correctly on the various relevant tools (hopefully Calva Notebooks, Oz, Clerk, Portal, etc.).\nIn this meeting, we wish to discuss the details of the plan.\n\nJoining\nPlease use the Going button at the top of this post to mark your participation.\nYou can also use the Add to Calendar to add the event to your calendar.\n\nLength\nThe official part will be 90 minutes long.\nSometimes some of us like to stay longer and chat.\n\nPlatform\n\nvideo call zoom link: Launch Meeting - Zoom\n\ntopic thread at the Clojurians Zulip chat: #visual-tools / meeting 15\n\n\n\nRecording\nThe meeting will be recorded and shared publicly.\nSome parts will be unrecorded.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/303371281

LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Biff coding #7: try to run untrusted Babashka code with Fly.io Machines\n\nBefore the full glory of Platypub can be realized, we need a good setup for running untrusted user code on demand (see #21). I think Fly Machines might be the answer. We'll go through the docs on that page and hopefully get a hello-world Babashka script running in a sandbox before our time runs out.\nBackground: Platypub is a blogging platform that supports custom themes. A theme is just a Babashka script that spits out a folder of HTML files and such. That makes custom themes very flexible, but also means that we can't deploy a publicly-accessible production instance of Platypub until we have a safe way to run the theme code. The theme script will run whenever a user needs to preview or publish to their blog.\nAs always, this will be completely unscripted and un-prepared-for. Hopefully we don't end up having to sit and do nothing for 5 minutes while a Docker container builds, or something.\nRSVP for access to the Zoom link.\n---\nTwice per month we'll hack on a Biff project together. One week I'll do a solo coding session, and the other we'll do pair programming if someone has signed up. It'll be relaxed, no preparation required. Afterwards we can chat if anyone has anything to talk about.\nAll meetups will be held on Zoom. We'll record the coding session, and the post-coding chat part will be unrecorded.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/301402168

Reveal (https://github.com/vlaaad/reveal) aims to solve\nthis problem by creating an in-process repl output pane that makes\ninspecting values as easy as selecting an interesting datum. It\nrecognizes the value of text as a universal interface, that's why its\noutput looks like a text: you can select it, copy it, save it into a\nfile. Unlike text, reveal output holds references to printed values,\nmaking inspecting selected value a matter of opening a context menu.\nVlad is a software developer currently buliding desktop applications\nin Clojure.

DESCRIPTION:Workshop: How to explain Data-Oriented programming to non-Clojure developers\n\nIn this workshop we will explore strategies and methods for explaining the benefits of Data-Oriented programming (a.k.a just use maps) to non-Clojure developers.\nIn addition to the need of finding the appropriate library for persistent data structures, we need to think also about the integration of persistent data structures into an existing code base and how to overcome cultural habits of developers.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/230059595

SUMMARY:Clojure - JVM + BEAM = Clojerl
LOCATION:online
DESCRIPTION:Juan Facorro (https://github.com/jfacorro) will be presenting:\nClojure was designed to be a hosted language, it is meant to run on\nmore platforms than the JVM, which is part of the reason why Clojerl\n(https://github.com/clojerl) was born. The BEAM (the name for the\nErlang VM) is a powerful virtual machine that offers tools and\nmechanisms to build resiliency into the systems that run on it. This\nsession will explore some of these aspects and how you can use them\nwhile staying in the comfort of your Clojure home.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/228766551

DESCRIPTION:Data Oriented Programming in Practice\n\nYehonathan Sharvit (https://twitter.com/viebel) will be presenting:\nClojure guides us to think in terms of immutable data and write most\nof our code as functions that manipulate data. As a Clojure\nprogrammer, you feel it and you take it for granted. In this talk, we\nare going to put words on this “feeling” and explore together what are\nthe core principles of data-oriented programming. We will discover\nthat those principles are in fact language agnostic and can be applied\nin other programming languages.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/220358876

Everyone talks about RDD but what it is really? Why is Clojure’s REPL\nnot like other languages’ REPLs? Can you really develop an\napplication “live”? What about restarts, refreshes? Don’t I need\nspecial, magical tooling for this? This talk will show you how\nfundamental Clojure’s REPL is to development, and how to build a web\napplication, live, from your editor, with no restarts, no refreshes,\njust simple, basic tooling. Clojure’s REPL is truly its superpower:\nit lets you hold your application in your hand, query it, modify it,\nevolve it, with just a basic set of tools and an understanding of what\n“REPL-friendly development” means.\n\nZulip: https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/262224-events/near/215374360
